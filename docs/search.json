It also covers the problems I encountered along the way when working on the project and what I did to overcome them.\nGenerally, I realised most of the time I encountered errors relating to calling the correct column names. This is because I make a lot of changes to the original dataset. From the beginning, I already cleaned, filtered and tidied the original data a few times, renaming certain columns in the process. Therefore, I have to ensure I am calling columns that exist in the dataset I am using currently. To resolve this issue, I checked through each line of code to ensure the variables existed and are keyed in correctly (uppercase, lowercase) to ensure consistency. Most of the time, I was able to troubleshoot by checking each line of code. It is therefore crucial to add comments at key sections of the code to indicate what I am intending to achieve, such that when I look back at huge chunks of code in future I am not confused and am able to troubleshoot line-by-line."

    "text": "What are my key takeaways from the Final Project?\nI’ve learnt the importance of visualisation plots in offering an alternative way to present, read and understand information. In my original data set, information was presented in an untidy manner which made it difficult to observe trends over the years. Furthermore, the values for my project range in the millions to billions zone and contain long string of numbers. By converting these data into visualisation plots, it makes understanding the data set a lot less taxing and a lot clearer visually.\nBeyond this module, the ability to translate large datasets into visual formats is a powerful tool in a wide range of applications. In my studies, the ability to translate large datasets into visual formats can facilitate better decision-making and more persuasive presentations. In research, which is a key component for students studying Psychology like myself and have an interest in pursuing a graduate degree, it can help in easier identification of trends, patterns, or outliers, which is vital for drawing meaningful conclusions from data. In the work I do in future, it can make complex information more accessible but also more compelling."

    "title": "Data Story: The Big Picture",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To answer this question, data was obtained from Kaggle, a public data source. In the context of my data story, air transportation trends is scoped to focus specifically on the number of air passengers, allowing for a concentrated analysis of passenger traffic — an essential indicator of the aviation industry’s health and vitality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this data set, air passengers counted are based on the following criteria: individuals are counted only once per flight number, irrespective of the number of legs on their journey, to prevent double-counting those who remain on board for multiple segments. This includes both fare-paying and non-fare-paying passengers as long as their flight starts or ends at the reporting airport, as well as those transferring to different flights. However, direct transit passengers who stay on the same aircraft during a stopover and do not switch planes, are excluded to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nIn understanding the question, I looked at overarching trends first. Which EU27 country carried the most number of air passengers over the years? Which year saw the most number of air passengers? To answer these, I conducted data analyses, beginning with trying to obtain a big picture of what the data in the data set represents.\n\n\nHeatmaps simplify complex data into an easily interpretable visual format, allowing for quick pattern recognition and analysis. It provides immediate insights into trends and outliers as high and low values are instantly recognisable due to color intensity differences. Heatmaps capture the essence of the data’s story without the need for complex interpretation, making it accessible to a broad audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith deeper hues signifying higher passenger counts, it becomes immediately apparent that Germany and Spain, followed by France and Italy, consistently outperform the rest of the EU27 countries in air travel density. This heatmap also starkly highlights the tumultuous impact of global events on travel trends. The years 2020 and 2021 are markedly distinguished by a pronounced dip in color intensity, corresponding to a significant contraction in air travel, serving as a visual quantifier of the pandemic’s impact on air travel across the EU27 region.\nOverall, the heatmap dynamically tracks the ebb and flow of air travel trends, presenting a timeline that reflects both the stability of leading nations in air transport and the vulnerability of the sector to external events like the pandemic.\nThereafter, I dived deeper into understanding general trends by investigating the number of passengers with various variables, particularly the country and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows the total number of passengers carried by each country from 2011 to 2022. It provides a comparison between countries, allowing for a better understanding of which EU27 countries were more popular. From the graph, countries with higher peaks include France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain whereas countries with lower peaks include Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows there was a steady increase in the total number of passengers carried from 2011 to 2019, with 2019 being the year with the most number of passengers carried before a sharp drop in 2020.\nTo better understand growth patterns for EU27 countries as a whole, a growth rate line graph on the total number of passengers carried each year was generated. The growth rate line graph mirrored the bar graph in revealing consistent growth for EU27 countries from 2011 to 2019. In the pre-pandemic years, the lowest growth rate occurred between 2011 and 2012 at a rate of 0.66%, while the highest growth rate occurred between 2016 to 2017 at a rate of 8.40%.\nWith the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, the growth rate from 2019 to 2020 fell by a sharp -73.44%. As we all know and experienced it, the outbreak of the pandemic led to lockdowns worldwide and travel restrictions. With the easing of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the growth rate from 2020 to 2021 picked up again at a rate of 39.09%. While many other countries worldwide, particularly in the region of Asia, remained in lockdown in 2020, EU27 leaders announced on June 30 2020 that it would reopen its borders to travellers from 14 countries. This was its first step towards lifting travel restrictions, allowing for air travel to gradually pick up again. With the complete lifting of lockdowns and easing of travel restrictions, the growth rate of total number of passengers carried across EU27 countries from 2021 to 2022 increased to 117.73%. This sharp recovery brought passengers carried closer to pre-pandemic levels, with the total number of passengers in 2022 being closely similar to that of 2015.\n\n\n\nTo complement my understanding of the previous bar chart on the number of passengers by year, I decided to improve on this visualisation plot and modify it into a stacked bar chart. This allows me to use colour-coded schemes to differentiate each country and create a stratified depiction of annual contributions, facilitating an immediate comprehension of each country’s share. Based on the stacked bar plot, it is clear that countries from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands have been steadfast in their roles as principal contributors to the aggregate number of air passengers, year after year. This highlights the dominant aviation markets within the EU27, with Germany taking the lead in pre pandemic years and Spain taking the lead in post pandemic years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you’ve grasped a basic understanding of current trends, you might be curious (just like me!) as to how recovery trends will look like especially in a post COVID-19 world! Therefore, I also worked on a predicted growth rates line graph to help me predict future trends.\nThis line graph depicts predicted growth rates for the years 2012 to 2027, but the values for 2012 to 2019 correspond to the values from the line graph on year-on-year growth rates under the “Number of Passengers by Year” tab as mentioned earlier. I have kept these data in this visualisation plot to provide you with a full picture of how growth rates have developed and could be developing in future!\nIn calculating predicted growth rates, only data from 2011 to 2019 was used. The rationale for this stems from the extraordinary circumstances of 2020, where the COVID-19 pandemic introduced extreme deviations from established trends. Therefore, calculating predicted growth rates based on historical data from 2011 to 2022, which includes 2020, is non-representative of the normative progression observed in the preceding years.\nOne caveat of such a prediction model is that the predicted growth rates graph was generated on the assumption that air travel trends pre and post COVID-19 will remain somewhat similar. That is, I expect the continuity of air travel trends as observed in the pre-COVID era, projecting forward into the post-pandemic landscape. This presupposes a degree of stability and resilience in travel behaviors and industry patterns that may not fully account for the potential long-term shifts engendered by the pandemic — ranging from changes in consumer confidence and business travel norms to structural shifts in the global economy and international mobility.\nNevertheless, the model affords a distinct advantage: it offers a hypothetical trajectory for 2020 through 2022 — a counter-factual narrative of what might have been in the absence of the pandemic. By extrapolating from the historical data that predates COVID-19, the model depicts a projection of growth rates untainted by the pandemic’s impact. For instance, had the pandemic not occurred, the predicted growth rate for 2020 stands at a promising 7.87%, with expectations set for a consistent uptrend through to 2027. By juxtaposing this potential growth against the stark reality — a sharp decline to -73.44% in 2020 as seen in the year-on-year growth rates graph above — the contrasting figures illuminate the disruption of the pandemic. This alternate timeline offers valuable insights, serving as a comparative baseline against which to measure the actual pandemic-induced deviations, thereby enhancing our understanding of the pandemic’s true effect on air travel trends.\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering… why is understanding these numbers on the total number of air passengers carried important?\nFor the EU27 as a cohesive entity, it informs strategic policy development and infrastructure expansion to manage the flow of travelers effectively and sustaineably. This is particularly crucial for the EU27, where borderless movement is a foundational principle. Depending on changes in passenger counts in a post pandemic world, it becomes imperative to anticipate the need for enhanced airport capacity, resource optimisation and public health measures to foster a resilient air travel network."

I was particularly interested in looking at how much the numbers have dwindled since the outbreak of the pandemic, and how much air travel picked up in a post COVID world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this line graph, it is evident that there is a steady increase in the number of air travel passengers since 2011, up till the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019. From 2019-2020, the number of passengers decreased sharply. Following the opening up of borders again from 2020 onwards, there was a gradual increase in the number of passengers again in 2021, and a sharper increase from 2021-2022."

    "title": "Data Story: The Big Picture",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To answer this question, data was obtained from Kaggle, a public data source. In the context of my data story, air transportation trends is scoped to focus specifically on the number of air passengers, allowing for a concentrated analysis of passenger traffic — an essential indicator of the aviation industry’s health and vitality.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this data set, air passengers counted are based on the following criteria: individuals are counted only once per flight number, irrespective of the number of legs on their journey, to prevent double-counting those who remain on board for multiple segments. This includes both fare-paying and non-fare-paying passengers as long as their flight starts or ends at the reporting airport, as well as those transferring to different flights. However, direct transit passengers who stay on the same aircraft during a stopover and do not switch planes, are excluded to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nIn understanding the question, I looked at overarching trends first. Which EU27 country carried the most number of air passengers over the years? Which year saw the most number of air passengers? To answer these, I conducted data analyses, beginning with trying to obtain a big picture of what the data in the data set represents.\n\n\nHeatmaps simplify complex data into an easily interpretable visual format, allowing for quick pattern recognition and analysis. It provides immediate insights into trends and outliers as high and low values are instantly recognisable due to color intensity differences. Heatmaps capture the essence of the data’s story without the need for complex interpretation, making it accessible to a broad audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith deeper hues signifying higher passenger counts, it becomes immediately apparent that Germany and Spain, followed by France and Italy, consistently outperform the rest of the EU27 countries in air travel density. This heatmap also starkly highlights the tumultuous impact of global events on travel trends. The years 2020 and 2021 are markedly distinguished by a pronounced dip in color intensity, corresponding to a significant contraction in air travel, serving as a visual quantifier of the pandemic’s impact on air travel across the EU27 region.\nOverall, the heatmap dynamically tracks the ebb and flow of air travel trends, presenting a timeline that reflects both the stability of leading nations in air transport and the vulnerability of the sector to external events like the pandemic.\nThereafter, I dived deeper into understanding general trends by investigating the number of passengers with various variables, particularly the country and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows the total number of passengers carried by each country from 2011 to 2022. It provides a comparison between countries, allowing for a better understanding of which EU27 countries were more popular. From the graph, countries with higher peaks include France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain whereas countries with lower peaks include Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows there was a steady increase in the total number of passengers carried from 2011 to 2019, with 2019 being the year with the most number of passengers carried before a sharp drop in 2020.\nTo better understand growth patterns for EU27 countries as a whole, a growth rate line graph on the total number of passengers carried each year was generated. The growth rate line graph mirrored the bar graph in revealing consistent growth for EU27 countries from 2011 to 2019. In the pre-pandemic years, the lowest growth rate occurred between 2011 and 2012 at a rate of 0.66%, while the highest growth rate occurred between 2016 to 2017 at a rate of 8.40%.\nWith the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, the growth rate from 2019 to 2020 fell by a sharp -73.44%. As we all know and experienced it, the outbreak of the pandemic led to lockdowns worldwide and travel restrictions. With the easing of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the growth rate from 2020 to 2021 picked up again at a rate of 39.09%. While many other countries worldwide, particularly in the region of Asia, remained in lockdown in 2020, EU27 leaders announced on June 30 2020 that it would reopen its borders to travellers from 14 countries. This was its first step towards lifting travel restrictions, allowing for air travel to gradually pick up again. With the complete lifting of lockdowns and easing of travel restrictions, the growth rate of total number of passengers carried across EU27 countries from 2021 to 2022 increased to 117.73%. This sharp recovery brought passengers carried closer to pre-pandemic levels, with the total number of passengers in 2022 being closely similar to that of 2015.\n\n\n\nTo complement my understanding of the previous bar chart on the number of passengers by year, I decided to improve on this visualisation plot and modify it into a stacked bar chart. This allows me to use colour-coded schemes to differentiate each country and create a stratified depiction of annual contributions, facilitating an immediate comprehension of each country’s share. Based on the stacked bar plot, it is clear that countries from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands have been steadfast in their roles as principal contributors to the aggregate number of air passengers, year after year. This highlights the dominant aviation markets within the EU27, with Germany taking the lead in pre pandemic years and Spain taking the lead in post pandemic years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you’ve grasped a basic understanding of current trends, you might be curious (just like me!) as to how recovery trends will look like especially in a post COVID-19 world! Therefore, I also worked on a predicted growth rates line graph to help me predict future trends.\nThis line graph depicts predicted growth rates for the years 2012 to 2027, but the values for 2012 to 2019 correspond to the values from the line graph on year-on-year growth rates under the “Number of Passengers by Year” tab as mentioned earlier. I have kept these data in this visualisation plot to provide you with a full picture of how growth rates have developed and could be developing in future!\nIn calculating predicted growth rates, only data from 2011 to 2019 was used. The rationale for this stems from the extraordinary circumstances of 2020, where the COVID-19 pandemic introduced extreme deviations from established trends. Therefore, calculating predicted growth rates based on historical data from 2011 to 2022, which includes 2020, is non-representative of the normative progression observed in the preceding years.\nOne caveat of such a prediction model is that the predicted growth rates graph was generated on the assumption that air travel trends pre and post COVID-19 will remain somewhat similar. That is, I expect the continuity of air travel trends as observed in the pre-COVID era, projecting forward into the post-pandemic landscape. This presupposes a degree of stability and resilience in travel behaviors and industry patterns that may not fully account for the potential long-term shifts engendered by the pandemic — ranging from changes in consumer confidence and business travel norms to structural shifts in the global economy and international mobility.\nNevertheless, the model affords a distinct advantage: it offers a hypothetical trajectory for 2020 through 2022 — a counter-factual narrative of what might have been in the absence of the pandemic. By extrapolating from the historical data that predates COVID-19, the model depicts a projection of growth rates untainted by the pandemic’s impact. For instance, had the pandemic not occurred, the predicted growth rate for 2020 stands at a promising 7.87%, with expectations set for a consistent uptrend through to 2027. By juxtaposing this potential growth against the stark reality — a sharp decline to -73.44% in 2020 as seen in the year-on-year growth rates graph above — the contrasting figures illuminate the disruption of the pandemic. This alternate timeline offers valuable insights, serving as a comparative baseline against which to measure the actual pandemic-induced deviations, thereby enhancing our understanding of the pandemic’s true effect on air travel trends.\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering… why is understanding these numbers on the total number of air passengers carried important?\nFor the EU27 as a cohesive entity, it informs strategic policy development and infrastructure expansion to manage the flow of travelers effectively and sustaineably. This is particularly crucial for the EU27, where borderless movement is a foundational principle. Depending on changes in passenger counts in a post pandemic world, it becomes imperative to anticipate the need for enhanced airport capacity, resource optimisation and public health measures to foster a resilient air travel network."

This encourages exploration tailored to personal preferences or interests, allowing for a customisable exploration of each nation’s unique air travel narrative. How have the air passenger trends within each country shifted through the annals of time? What might the skies hold for each country as they chart their course into the future?\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, across all countries, there is a consistent trend of the number of passengers increasing steadily until the outbreak of the pandemic, resulting in a sharp drop from 2019 to 2020. In the subsequent year, while the initial shock to air travel began to abate, only a modest rebound was observed. Moving into 2022, this recovery trajectory was more pronounced, with some nations witnessing a resurgence in passenger numbers that approached pre-pandemic figures, signaling a resilient, albeit gradual, return to form for the aviation sector.\nBeyond understanding the total number of passengers carried by each country across all years, the growth rate line graph provides a deeper understanding of how the numbers increase or decrease over the years. It reveals intricate patterns of progression or regression in passenger numbers that each country experiences annually.\n\n\n\nTo understand future trends for individual countries, a predicted growth rate line graph was depicted. The prediction model was based on a simple linear regression model that took values from the post-pandemic landscape of 2020-2022. This deliberate choice mitigates the distortion of the predictive analytics that might arise from incorporating the full historical data set from 2011 to 2022, which includes the outlier period of the pandemic onset. Unlike the previous prediction model used to predict general growth rates, this model is predicated under the premise that the post-pandemic period has set a new baseline for air travel trends where previous trends may no longer hold true. By focusing on this recent period, the model seeks to provide a more refined and representative forecast that aligns with the current trajectory of recovery and adjustment within the aviation industry. I felt that for general growth rates, a longer historical perspective might be more insightful to observe long-term trends. On the contrary, for individual countries’ growth rates, I felt a narrower approach focusing on the latest data from 2020 to 2022 would be more suitable as it helps us understand and forecast short-term recovery.\nHowever, a limitation of this model is that only 3 data points were utilised. Therefore, this model’s ability to capture and predict complex trends is inherently constrained. It lacks the robustness that a larger and more diverse set of historical data points could provide, potentially affecting the accuracy of its long-term predictions. This limitation underscores the model’s nature as a directional guide rather than a definitive forecast, necessitating cautious interpretation and the understanding that the predictions are but one piece in the complex puzzle of post-pandemic recovery.\n\n\n\nFor individual EU27 countries, a thorough understanding of air passenger volumes is a critical tool for shaping national strategies. It informs economic policies aimed at revitalisation, particularly as nations emerge from the pandemic’s shadow. These figures are also instrumental in tailoring public health directives, ensuring that the resurgence of travel does not compromise safety.\nFurthermore, this aids countries in adapting to broader EU27 trends, allowing them to align national policies with regional objectives and collaborative efforts for a cohesive recovery trajectory across the continent. Understanding passenger numbers thus enables individual countries to make informed decisions that reflect both their unique circumstances and their role within the EU27."

This limitation underscores the model’s nature as a directional guide rather than a definitive forecast, necessitating cautious interpretation and the understanding that the predictions are but one piece in the complex puzzle of post-pandemic recovery.\n\n\n\nFor individual EU27 countries, a thorough understanding of air passenger volumes is a critical tool for shaping national strategies. It informs economic policies aimed at revitalisation, particularly as nations emerge from the pandemic’s shadow. These figures are also instrumental in tailoring public health directives, ensuring that the resurgence of travel does not compromise safety.\nFurthermore, this aids countries in adapting to broader EU27 trends, allowing them to align national policies with regional objectives and collaborative efforts for a cohesive recovery trajectory across the continent. Understanding passenger numbers thus enables individual countries to make informed decisions that reflect both their unique circumstances and their role within the EU27."
